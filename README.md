# Chip-8-emulator
My first emulator project and helped me understand
- Opcodes
- How to use sfml
- memory management

You can find the chip 8 roms elsewhere I personally got them from https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms/games
Includes Tetris rom already and should be the default when you run ./chip8

You will need to install SFML to build and to run it: ./chip8 (how big you want the screen) (the delay you want to set) (the rom name)
