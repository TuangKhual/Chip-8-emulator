# Chip-8-emulator
My first emulator project

You can find the chip 8 roms elsewhere I personally got them from https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms/games
It's still very bare bones I plan to add sound and a gui where you can choose to load roms or even save the gae

You will need to install SFML if you haven't already and to run it: ./chip8 (how big you want the screen) (the delay you want to set) (the rom name)
